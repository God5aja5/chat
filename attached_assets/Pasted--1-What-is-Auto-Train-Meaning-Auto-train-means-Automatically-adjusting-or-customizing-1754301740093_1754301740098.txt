🧠 1. What is Auto Train?

✅ Meaning:

“Auto train” means:

> Automatically adjusting or customizing the AI's behavior based on previous chats or user preferences.



Even though OpenAI API cannot train models on-the-fly, you can simulate training by saving chat data and using it in the prompt.

💡 How to Implement "Auto Train" (Simulated)

Example:

If a user always asks about coding, you can "auto-train" by inserting a system prompt like:

{ "role": "system", "content": "You are a coding assistant who explains JavaScript simply." }

Steps to simulate "training":

1. Save user preferences (e.g. topic: coding, personality: friendly)


2. Use that info to change the system prompt every time



✅ Bonus: Save their past questions and insert into prompt to simulate memory.

🔧 Simple Code (Auto Train Simulated)

const userPreferences = {
  style: "friendly",
  interest: "JavaScript"
};

const autoTrainedPrompt = `You are a ${userPreferences.style} assistant that helps users learn about ${userPreferences.interest}.`;

const messages = [
  { role: "system", content: autoTrainedPrompt },
  { role: "user", content: "Explain promises in JS" }
];

This makes it feel like the AI is “trained” on what the user likes.

🎨 2. What is Custom Prompt?

✅ Meaning:

> Letting users select the AI's personality, mood, or role by changing the system prompt.




---

🔥 Example Prompts:

Name	System Prompt

Teacher	“You are a strict but kind school teacher who explains slowly.”
Hacker	“You are a dark, elite hacker who explains technology with code examples.”
Girlfriend	“You are a sweet and supportive girlfriend who talks casually and warmly.”
GPT Expert	“You are GPT trained on GPT prompts. Only reply with advanced prompt tricks.”

💡 How to Add Custom Prompt in Your App:

1. On UI: let user choose a prompt from dropdown or buttons


2. Save that choice (in localStorage or DB)


3. Use it in the API like:



const messages = [
  { role: "system", content: selectedCustomPrompt },
  { role: "user", content: userInput }
];


---

💥 Combine Both: Auto-Train + Custom Prompt

Let user:

Choose a base custom prompt (e.g. “Doctor”)

Auto-train from usage (e.g. user asks about heart → adjust to "Cardiologist")


You dynamically update the system prompt like:

"You are a calm, polite medical assistant specialized in cardiology."

This feels like the AI "learned" the user’s interest = auto-train ✅
