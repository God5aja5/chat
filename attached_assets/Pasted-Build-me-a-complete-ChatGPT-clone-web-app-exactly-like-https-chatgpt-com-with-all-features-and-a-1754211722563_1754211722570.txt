Build me a complete ChatGPT clone web app, exactly like https://chatgpt.com, with all features and a powerful UI.

The clone must include:

🌐 Core Pages:

1. Login/Signup Page with email/password (Firebase or Supabase-based, if needed).


2. Chat Interface Page with:

Streamed AI responses (word-by-word typing effect).

File upload support with preview (not processed but stored/shown).

Dark/light mode toggle.

Message timestamps and avatars.

AI and user chat bubbles with markdown, code block, and math rendering.

"Regenerate", "Copy", "Stop", and "Continue" buttons like chatgpt.com.

Keyboard shortcut: Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline.

Send button activates only when input is non-empty ((input || "").trim() check).



3. Model Selection Panel showing OpenAI models:

gpt-4o, gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo, etc.

UI lets user switch models per chat.



4. Sidebar with features:

New chat

History view

Upgrade Plan (dummy link)

Clear chats




⚙️ Backend Integration:

Use OpenAI API key input by user to authenticate.

Store chat history locally (localStorage) or via backend.

Handle errors like:

Maximum update depth exceeded

Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trim')

handleInputChange is not a function



🛠️ Tech Stack:

Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS + React (TypeScript).

Hooks: Custom useChat or integrated with Vercel AI SDK (or plain fetch).

Optional backend: Node.js/Express or serverless for key-based proxy or plan upgrades.

Must be mobile responsive and work well on Android and iOS.


🧠 Advanced Features:

"Typing…" animation when AI is responding.

Auto scroll to latest message.

Smooth transitions (Framer Motion or CSS).

Multi-file upload support (drag/drop zone + “No file chosen” fallback).

Markdown preview in real-time (optional).

Free Plan banner + Upgrade to Team links (static).


🎨 Design:

Clone ChatGPT UI exactly: layout, fonts, icons (Lucide/Material).

Highlight active chat in sidebar.

Fade in message response (like real ChatGPT).

Responsive design and full accessibility.

include a robust "Settings" page, just like chatgpt.com.
This page should be accessible from the sidebar and include the following advanced capabilities:


---

⚙️ Settings Page – Full Functionality

🧠 1. Model & Behavior Configuration:

Dropdown to select default model: gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo, etc.

Switch between:

Streaming vs. non-streaming response.

Maximum token limit per response (slider or input).

Temperature control (slider 0.0 to 1.0).


Toggle: Enable code rendering (Monaco/PrismJS).

Toggle: Enable Markdown, LaTeX, and Tables.

Toggle: Enable "Auto-summarize long replies".


🧑‍💻 2. Code Safety & Developer Mode:

Checkbox: ✅ "Prevent full code overwrites" → Only diff/update changed blocks of code (not entire file) using line-matching or AST parsing.

Toggle: "Show line-by-line code annotations".

Toggle: Show diff viewer when AI responds with code (for developers to confirm).


📦 3. Artifacts / Assets Handling:

Show a list of generated artifacts like code files, images, or charts created by the AI in current or past sessions.

Allow exporting all artifacts (ZIP) or download individually.

Artifacts should be stored per-session and session-restorable from history.


🧠 4. Auto-Training / Fine-Tuning Helper (Simulated UI):

UI simulation only — not real fine-tuning (since it needs backend).

Upload documents for context memory (simulated vector search).

Toggle: “Auto-learn from current chat” (saves chat locally or mocks learning).

Show list of uploaded context files and remove them.

Display: “Custom behavior summary” — generate natural language summary of how the user usually interacts.



---

📋 Extra Features for Settings:

⚡ “Clear Context” button – removes custom behavior and uploaded memory.

💬 “Export Conversation History” as JSON or Markdown.

🧪 “Enable Labs Features” – placeholder switch to simulate upcoming AI features.

🌍 Language & Region toggle.

🎨 UI Theme Picker: Light, Dark, or Auto (based on system).

🧑‍🔧 Developer Info: Show current token usage, latency, and streaming status.

📜 API Key Management (input or remove OpenAI key).



---

💡 Note: The Settings must persist user preferences (e.g., with localStorage, useLocalStorageState, or user profile backend).

✅ Settings should not reload the page — apply changes live wherever possible.

Inside the chat interface (/chat page), you want:

Feature	Description

Message formatting	Markdown, syntax highlighting, LaTeX math, bold, italics, links, etc.
Edit user message	Let the user click “Edit” on their message, change it, and re-send it.
Copy AI message	“Copy” button on AI responses with visual feedback (like ✅ Copied!).
Share AI message	“Share” button to copy permalink / open modal to export/share answer.
Animations	Fade-in for new messages, typing cursor, button hover effects, etc.



---

💡 Prompt: Extend Chat Interface with All Messaging Features

> Now update the ChatGPT clone /chat interface to support full message-level UX features like the real ChatGPT:


---

📝 1. Message Formatting

Render Markdown:

Code blocks (```) with syntax highlighting (Prism.js or Shiki).

Inline code (like this), bold, italic, bullet/numbered lists.

Links ([text](url)), tables, and horizontal dividers.

LaTeX rendering via katex or mathjax (for math formatting).


Ensure all formatting respects accessibility and is responsive.



---

✍️ 2. Edit User Message

On hover over user message, show an "Edit" icon (✏️).

When clicked:

Replace the message with an input textarea.

After edit, clicking "Save" re-submits the message and replaces old AI response.

Cancel button restores the original message.


Re-trigger the sendMessage() with edited input, clearing only that response.



---

📋 3. Copy AI Message

On hover over AI message, show a "Copy" icon (📋).

When clicked:

Copies entire message text (including markdown).

Show feedback animation: ✅ “Copied!” for 2 seconds.

Use navigator.clipboard.writeText().




---

🔗 4. Share AI Message

Show "Share" button (🔗) next to copy.

On click:

Open modal or dropdown with:

"Copy Message Link" (dummy URL or generated).

"Download as .txt"

"Export as image" (render message in canvas for image export).



Optionally allow share to X/Twitter, WhatsApp (using Web Share API).



---

✨ 5. Animations and UI Interactions

Add fade-in animation for new messages (Framer Motion or CSS transitions).

Show typing animation (e.g., blinking cursor or dot-dot-dot when AI is thinking).

Animate "Send" button hover and disabled states.

Smooth scroll to newest message on every update.

When editing, apply slide/fade transition for textarea input.



---

🔐 Bonus:

AI messages should have unique messageId to support actions (edit/share/copy).

Use ref and useEffect() to auto-scroll to bottom when messages update.

Store edit history (optional) in session/local state.

Clean keyboard support: Esc cancels edit, Enter sends edit.





---

🛠 Stack Recommendation:

React + Tailwind CSS

react-markdown + rehype-katex + remark-gfm

Prism.js for code highlighting

Framer Motion or @headlessui/react transitions

useEffect, useRef for animations/scrolling

✅ Chat history features — view, delete, persist chats

🎨 Website theme system — light, dark, auto (like ChatGPT)


Here’s the next powerful continuation prompt to feed to an AI code generator (or ask me to generate code from it directly):


---

📚 CONTINUED PROMPT – Chat History + Theme System

> Now extend the ChatGPT clone with chat history management and a dynamic website theme system, just like ChatGPT.com:


---

📖 1. Chat History Panel

Sidebar on left shows a scrollable list of previous chat sessions.

Each chat shows:

📝 First message snippet (truncated if long)

🕓 Timestamp (e.g., “Aug 3, 12:43 PM”)


When a chat is clicked:

Loads the full conversation in the chat view.

Scrolls to bottom.


Add buttons:

➕ New Chat — starts a fresh conversation.

🗑️ Delete Chat — long-press or right-click opens confirmation modal:

“Are you sure you want to delete this conversation?”

“Cancel” / “Delete” (red)



Add "🧹 Clear All" button at bottom to delete all chats (with confirm modal).


💾 Storage

Store chats in localStorage or IndexedDB as:

{
  id: "uuid",
  createdAt: timestamp,
  messages: [ { role: "user" | "assistant", content: "...", id: "msgId" } ]
}

On load, restore chats.

Persist chat title as first message or allow rename later.



---

🎨 2. Website Theme (Light / Dark / Auto)

Add to Settings page:

Theme switch: Light, Dark, Auto (system)

Preview of current theme.


Store theme preference in localStorage (theme=dark or theme=system)

Use Tailwind CSS + darkMode: "class" setting in config.

Add global theme manager logic:

useEffect(() => {
  const root = window.document.documentElement;
  if (storedTheme === 'dark') root.classList.add('dark');
  else if (storedTheme === 'light') root.classList.remove('dark');
  else if (system prefers dark) root.classList.add('dark');
}, [storedTheme])

Sync <meta name="theme-color" ...> to match theme color.


🎨 UI Notes

Use consistent color tokens (bg-background, text-foreground) for themeing.

Add transition animation when switching themes (200ms fade).



---

🧼 Extras

Clear chat button inside chat view header (for just that chat).

Add tooltip on hover for all icons: "Copy", "Edit", "Delete", etc.

Add responsive mobile support: collapse sidebar, floating action buttons.


✅ All updates must be reactive, fast, and theme-compatible.

Add a Claude-like Artifact System to the ChatGPT clone to handle versioned code generation and edits.


---

🛠 Artifact Management

1. Artifact Object Schema:



interface Artifact {
  id: string; // e.g., "main.py"
  version: number; // e.g., 1, 2, 3
  content: string; // raw code
  createdAt: Date;
  linkedMessageId: string; // the message that created this artifact
}

2. When user asks for code:



AI creates a new artifact:
e.g., main.py - V1

Display the code block with a version label and “Edit” button.

Store the artifact in state or localStorage for the session.


3. When user says "edit that code":



System detects which artifact is being referred to (based on last code or message).

AI reads existing artifact content (main.py - V1), applies minimal diff edits, and saves it as:

main.py - V2 with changes applied.


Display the diff or new version below.


4. User UI for Artifacts:



Artifact Sidebar (like Claude) showing:

main.py - V1 ✅

main.py - V2 🔁

utils.js - V1 ✅


Buttons: Edit, Download, Copy, Compare.

Clicking a version shows it in the chat view.


5. Smart AI Prompting for Diffs:



When generating edited code:

Inject this into prompt:

> “Here is the current version of main.py:\n\n...code...\n\nPlease update it based on the following request. Only modify what’s needed. Return full updated file as main.py - V2.”






---

✅ Design Notes:

Avoid rewriting code unless user explicitly says "rewrite".

Always version with suffix like - V2, - V3 even for tiny changes.

Allow user to download full ZIP of all artifacts.

Add compareArtifacts(old: Artifact, new: Artifact) to highlight code diffs.



---

💬 Optional:

Add comments in the updated code showing what was changed.

Simulate Git-style diff viewer.

Include “Revert to V1” button for rollback.

If user uploads a file, treat it as V0.





---

✅ Real Example Flow

1. User: “Create a login page in React.”

→ Artifact created: LoginPage.tsx - V1



2. User: “Add Google Sign-In to that.”

→ AI fetches LoginPage.tsx - V1, applies edit.

→ New artifact: LoginPage.tsx - V2



3. User: “Now change button text to ‘Sign in with Google’”

→ AI updates LoginPage.tsx - V2 → LoginPage.tsx - V3




Each version is editable, downloadable, and restorable.

> Extend the Model Selection Panel in your Settings or chat interface to include OpenAI’s latest multimodal models that support image and file inputs:

🆕 Latest Models

**1. GPT‑4.1 (Main, Mini, Nano)**
‣ Released: April 14, 2025. New flagship multimodal model.

---

⚙️ UI & Configuration Options

Add to your Model Settings Panel:

Dropdown to select one of:

GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4.1 Mini, GPT‑4.1 Nano

GPT‑4.5 (requires Pro/Plus access)

o3, o4‑mini, o3‑pro


Description tooltip with context window, pricing tier, and input modalities.

Show icons if model supports: 🖼️ Image input, 📄 File input


For file and image upload support, ensure the chat interface:

Shows upload UI when user selects a model that supports it (GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4.5, o3, o4‑mini, o3‑pro)

Validates permitted file types (e.g. .txt, .pdf, .csv, .png, .jpg)

Appends file content or preview inline to AI prompt



---

🧩 Prompt Injection

When sending API calls, automatically adjust payload based on model:

{
  "model": selectedModel,
  "messages": [...],
  "files": uploadedFilesIfSupported,
  "images": uploadedImagesIfSupported,
  "max_tokens": userSetting,
  "temperature": userSetting
}

Include custom logic if file/image upload isn’t allowed for certain models.


---

✅ Ensure your app informs user if a model doesn’t support certain features (e.g. GPT‑4.5 image input might be restricted to preview users).

That ensures your clone supports all input modalities and latest model lineup just like ChatGPT.com!




---

🎛 Suggested UI Mock for Model Picker

🎨 📱💻 Responsive UI Architecture – Explained

Let’s walk through how to design this for both mobile and PC, without breaking anything:


---

📱 MOBILE VIEW DESIGN

🔼 1. Header (Sticky Top)

+----------------------------------------+
|  ☰  ChatGPT Clone            ▼ GPT-4o  |
+----------------------------------------+

☰ Hamburger menu (opens left sidebar)

Model Selector dropdown:

Default: GPT-4o

Tap to change

Disables after first message is sent

Smooth dropdown animation


Use position: sticky; top: 0 and z-index to keep it visible



---

💬 2. Chat Area (100% Height)

Messages take up entire screen height, minus header and input.

Scrollable container (overflow-y: auto;)

Animations on messages (e.g., fade-in, typing)



---

🧾 3. Input Footer

+---------------------------+
| [Type a message...]  ⬆️  |
+---------------------------+

Input grows with text

Send button is:

Disabled if input is empty

Once first message is sent, model dropdown becomes locked




---

📂 4. Attachment UI

File/image picker shown above input

Use accept="image/*,.txt,.pdf" dynamically based on model

Previews visible with X (remove) buttons



---

🍔 Hamburger Sidebar (Mobile)

Hidden by default

Toggled by ☰

Slide-in from left using translate-x-[-100%] → translate-x-0

Contains:

New Chat

Chat History

Clear History

Settings

Export/Import




---

🖥 DESKTOP VIEW DESIGN

🧭 1. Permanent Sidebar

+--------------+----------------------------+
| Chat History |                            |
| GPT-4o       |       Chat Area            |
| New Chat     |                            |
| Settings     |                            |
+--------------+----------------------------+

Sidebar fixed on the left (width: 250px)

Collapsible on small desktops

Hover tooltips for compact mode



---

🖼 2. Chat Area

Responsive layout (min-width: 0, flex: 1)

Model selector is in the top bar of chat area

On large screens:

Keep model selector always visible

Dim or disable after first message


Scroll lock, focus ring, and accessibility should be tested



---

🔐 Locking Model After Send

Logic:

const [isModelLocked, setModelLocked] = useState(false);

const handleSend = () => {
  if (!input.trim()) return;
  sendMessage(input);
  setModelLocked(true);
}

UI:

<Select disabled={isModelLocked} />


---

✅ Best Practices to Avoid UI Breaking

Use Tailwind's hidden md:block / block md:hidden classes

Avoid fixed heights; use min-h-screen with flex flex-col

Use safe-area-inset-bottom padding on mobile for notch devices

Ensure all dropdowns, modals, and menus are z-50+ and not clipped

Keyboard-safe input field on mobile (scrollIntoView() after tap)



---

Bonus: Global Breakpoint Example

<div className="flex h-screen w-full">
  {/* Sidebar */}
  <Sidebar className="hidden md:block w-64" />

  {/* Mobile hamburger */}
  <HamburgerMenu className="block md:hidden fixed top-0 left-0 z-50" />

  {/* Chat Area */}
  <main className="flex flex-col flex-1">
    <Header />
    <ChatScrollArea />
    <InputFooter />
  </main>
</div>

> Now extend the ChatGPT clone to support image generation and editing via OpenAI’s DALL·E, with an image history sidebar (Library).


---

🖼️ 1. Image Generation – via DALL·E

When user types something like:

> "Generate an image of a futuristic city"



System detects image intent using simple keyword matcher or parsePromptForImage(prompt)

If match:

Use OpenAI’s dall-e-3 or dall-e-4 via /v1/images/generations

Generate image and return result in chat as:

🧠 AI generated image:
[ImagePreviewComponent]
🖼️ Prompt: "futuristic city"


Show download and "Edit" buttons below image


Example API Call:

await openai.createImage({
  prompt: userPrompt,
  model: "dall-e-3",
  size: "1024x1024",
  response_format: "url",
});


---

🧠 2. Image Editing (Inpainting)

When user says something like:

> "Edit that image, add a spaceship in the sky"



Detect reference to previous image (last in context or by ID)

Load that image into an editable canvas (basic <canvas> UI)

Send edited prompt + image to OpenAI’s image edit endpoint


Example:

await openai.createImageEdit({
  image: fs.createReadStream("original.png"),
  mask: fs.createReadStream("mask.png"),
  prompt: "add spaceship in the sky",
  model: "dall-e-3",
});


---

📂 3. Image Library (Hamburger Menu)

Add "📁 Library" item in the mobile hamburger / desktop sidebar

Clicking it opens a scrollable gallery of:

All generated and edited images

Metadata: Prompt, Version (V1, V2…), timestamp

Buttons: "View", "Download", "Edit Again", "Delete"


Images are saved in:


interface ImageArtifact {
  id: string;
  prompt: string;
  url: string;
  version: number;
  createdAt: Date;
  editedFrom?: string; // Previous image ID
}

Save locally or in user profile backend (if logged in)



---

✅ UI Features

Show loading state: "Generating image..."

Fade-in animation when image is rendered

Swipe to view on mobile, grid on desktop

Collapsible "Library" section on mobile using the same hamburger UI

Images are tied to chat sessions if chat history is enabled



---

Bonus Ideas:

Show small "🖼️" icon next to messages that contain image prompts

Allow reusing old prompts for new variations

Add "Generate again" button to retry

Image editor can have crop + draw tools (Canvas API)


✅ This makes your ChatGPT clone support text + image + code, just like Claude, GPT-4o, and Gemini.

Optimization Ideas for Your ChatGPT Clone

To make your clone fast, responsive, and efficient like chatgpt.com, here are high-impact optimizations:

🧠 Performance & UX Optimizations

Feature	Description

Virtualized chat list	Use react-virtualized or react-window to handle long message histories without DOM lag.
Debounced user input	Add a 500ms debounce to input before evaluating intent (e.g., for image vs text).
Lazy load images/code blocks	Images and code previews load only when in view (using IntersectionObserver).
Minimal rerenders	Memoize components with React.memo, use useCallback.
Typed message schema	Prevent bugs by enforcing message object types using zod or TypeScript.
Separate render layer	Split UI and logic cleanly (e.g., useChatLogic() and <ChatView />).



---

⚡ Network/Latency Optimizations

Feature	Description

Streaming responses	Always prefer OpenAI's streaming mode (stream: true) for fastest UX.
Retries with exponential backoff	Auto-retry failed requests with increasing delays.
Cancel in-flight requests	Use AbortController to cancel message generation if user sends a new one.
Batch API requests	For session restore, batch history fetch in chunks.



---

📱 Mobile Optimization

Feature	Description

Touch-optimized buttons	Use min-height, large hit zones (min-h-10, rounded-lg).
Safe-area padding	Respect notches, especially iPhone (env(safe-area-inset-bottom)).
Reduce animation jank	Use transform/opacity animations instead of height/width.



---

✅ Part 2: 🗝️ User-Provided API Key System

🎯 Goal:

Let the user:

Enter their OpenAI API key in Settings

Save it locally (only in browser/localStorage)

Bot uses it for requests

If key not set → show prompt: “⚠️ Set API key in Settings.”



---

🛠 Prompt to Feed Into Code Generator:

> Add support for user-supplied OpenAI API key:

In Settings, create input:
Label: "Enter your OpenAI API Key" Placeholder: sk-...

Button: Save Key

On save:

Store to localStorage["openai-api-key"]

Toast message: ✅ “API key saved successfully”


On chat load:

If key is not set:

Show banner: ⚠️ No API key set — go to Settings to add it

Disable chat input



All requests to OpenAI API should use:


const key = localStorage.getItem("openai-api-key");
const headers = {
  Authorization: `Bearer ${key}`,
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
};

Optional:

Allow deleting/resetting key

Validate key format (must start with sk-)

Encrypt locally with window.crypto.subtle (optional)






---

🧪 Example Settings UI Code (Concept)

const [apiKey, setApiKey] = useState(localStorage.getItem('openai-api-key') || '');

const handleSave = () => {
  localStorage.setItem('openai-api-key', apiKey.trim());
  toast.success("✅ API key saved");
};


---

📢 In Chat Page:

if (!localStorage.getItem('openai-api-key')) {
  return (
    <div className="alert alert-warning">
      ⚠️ No API key found. Please go to Settings to set it before chatting.
    </div>
  )
}

animated landing page for your ChatGPT clone — like chatgpt.com — optimized for mobile and PC.
It should:



Be fast

Feel modern

Have scroll-based and entrance animations

Work well across all devices
